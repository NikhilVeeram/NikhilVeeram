- 👋 Hi, I’m @NikhilVeeram, a sophomore Interdisciplinary Engineering student at Texas A&M University
- 👀 I’m interested in C++, Python, Javascript, and a bunch of other coding languages. I also like retro games and analyzing how emulators work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to integrate artificial intelligence libraries into existing and new extracurricular Python projects that I am pursuing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects as I learn more!
- 📫 Contact me at: nikhilveeram@tamu.edu
